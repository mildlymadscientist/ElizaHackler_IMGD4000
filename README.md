# ElizaHackler_IMGD4000
 I started this Assignment with the provided GitHub tutorial and then implemented the psuedocode from the boids assignment, and implemented the tend_to_place tweek which can be changed through FVector variable place. I also implemented the speed slider in the Github tutorial Bonus section, but it was glitched for me and I had to remove it. 
The video is on the Github as well.
